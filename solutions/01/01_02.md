Day 1 - Part 2
==============

Step 1: Parse the input
-----------------------

### $group: Create depths array
1. Group on null to group all documents into a single document
2. Create an array called depths where each element is the full document ($$ROOT), including unique _id field

Step 2: Generate additional fields
-----------------------------------

### $project: Add index to depths array
1. Remove the _id field
2. Iterate through the depths array to add an explicit index field (i) to each element, move the existing fields into a new object (o)

### $set: Create the sliding windows
1. Iterate through the depths array to sum the current depth with the depths of the two previous elements
2. Set the first two elements to zero because they don't have two previous elements to sum

Step 3: Apply problem logic
---------------------------

### $project: Filter the sliding windows
1. Filter the depths array for elements where the sum is greater than the previous element's sum
2. Skip the first three elements because there aren't any previous elements to compare to

Step 4: Calculate the output
----------------------------

### $project: Calculate the result
1. Count the number of elements remaining in the depths array
